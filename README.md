# FPGA_project

In January 2021, I worked on some exciting projects involving digital hardware design for FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays). Here's a quick summary in simple terms:

1. **One-Bit ALU (2 Iteration):** - https://github.com/shreyaskale11/one_bit_ALU

2. **BCD to Seven-Segment Display:** - https://github.com/shreyaskale11/BCDtoSevensegmentdisplay 

3. **Full Adder:** - https://github.com/shreyaskale11/full_adder1

4. **Half Adder:** - https://github.com/shreyaskale11/halfadder 

5. **Flip-Flop:** - https://github.com/shreyaskale11/flipflop 

I did these projects out of curiosity because I wanted to learn how to create these essential building blocks using code on FPGA. It was a fun journey into the world of digital hardware!
